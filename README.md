Object Detection using Neural Networks
This project is an implementation of object detection using convolutional neural networks (CNN). The neural network architecture is utilized to detect and recognize objects within images, drawing bounding boxes around them and labeling each object.

Overview
Object detection is a computer vision task that involves identifying and locating objects of interest within an image or video. In this project, we employ a convolutional neural network to perform object detection. The network analyzes input images, identifies objects present in the images, and provides bounding box coordinates along with labels for each detected object.

Features
Detection of multiple objects within an image
Drawing bounding boxes around detected objects
Labeling detected objects with their respective class names

Usage
Provide an input image containing objects to be detected.
Execute the object detection script.
View the output image with detected objects, bounding boxes, and labels.

Credits
This project was inspired by the works of researchers and developers in the field of computer vision and deep learning.
